STAGE 1

1) compile sem1d:
./compile.sh
2) go to run/periodic_test
cd run/periodic_test
3) generate the periodic model
awk -f generate_model.awk > model.dat
4) visualize the elastic model:
xmgrace density velocity
5) run the SEM program
../../sem1d/bin/sem1D
6) visualize one displacement snapshot
xmgrace snapshot020
7)  visualize one strain snapshot
xmgrace snapshot_e019
8) visualize on stress snapshot
xmgrace snapshot_s019

Conclusion: displacement and stress are smooth and continuous. The seems to propagate in a homogeneous bar. 
This not the case for the stress
The question is: can we find an homogeneous 1-D bar for which displacement and strain are the "same"
as the one in the heterogeneous bar

STAGE 2

Compare with averaged models.

A) the average velocity is 1591.34m/s and density is 1000kg/m3
1) go to "velocity_av_test" directory
2) run SEM 
../../sem1d/bin/sem1D
3) compare current velocity model with the original one:
xmgrace  ../periodic_test/velocity velocity
4) compare displacement snapshots:
xmgrace ../periodic_test/snapshot020 snapshot020

Conclusion: this does not match! The true model is slower than this average one

B) if we averge the density and the elsatic parameter E, we obtain 
(E1=1336.3^2*1000=1607151974.4900; E2=1846.37^2*1100=3749990394.5900)
density: 1000kg/m3
velocity: 1636.63410221710826 m/s
1) go to "E_av_test" directory
2) run SEM 
../../sem1d/bin/sem1D
3) compare current velocity model with the original one:
xmgrace  ../periodic_test/velocity velocity
4) compare displacement snapshots:
xmgrace ../periodic_test/snapshot020 snapshot020

Conclusion: this does not match! The true model is still slower than this average one

C) if we average the density and the elastic parameter 1/E (the harmonic average), we obtain (Eav=(2/(1/E1+1/E2)))
density: 1000kg/m3
velocity:1500.00
1) go to "E_harmonic_av_test" directory
2) run SEM 
../../sem1d/bin/sem1D
3) compare current velocity model with the original one:
xmgrace  ../periodic_test/velocity velocity
4) compare displacement snapshots:
xmgrace ../periodic_test/snapshot020 snapshot020

This time they match!
But if you compare strain:
xmgrace ../periodic_test/snapshot_e020 snapshot_e020
we can see that, if the average look good, we are missing the fine scale part.
So, if a clever average seems to do the job for displacement and stress, it is clearly not enough for strain.

STAGE 3

 The difference between true displacement "u" and effective displacement u* varies with the periodicity of the model.
In periodic_test2 directory
1) generate the thinner periodic model:
awk -f generate_model.awk > model.dat
You can visualize the velocity model, you will see that the periodicity is twice thinner.
2) run SEM
../../sem1d/bin/sem1D
3) compare displacement snapshots:
xmgrace ../E_harmonic_av_test/snapshot020 ../periodic_test/snapshot020 snapshot020
But zooming, you can see that the difference is changing with periodicity: if the periodicity is twice shorter, 
the amplitude of the difference seems twice lower.
Looking at the strain:
xmgrace ../E_harmonic_av_test/snapshot_e020 ../periodic_test/snapshot_e020 snapshot_e020
things are different: the periodicity of the difference changes with the periodicity of the model, but not its amplitude ...

Homogenization will help to explain all these observation
